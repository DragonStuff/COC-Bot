# Clash of Clans Bot
Since everyone has split into different bots, they have made their own sources from this one. 
I will be updating this bot for my personal use, but everyone is free to follow the progress if they want to.

I am one of the founders of the open-source COC-Bot and I've taken a long break from programming with the others.
I will be working on this source specifically alone, but there are other more progressed bots now.

I personally support http://gamebot.org/ as they are open-source and all members of their forum have same privileges to the bot and it's releases.
